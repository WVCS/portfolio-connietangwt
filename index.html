  <h1 id="background"> Chinese-Homophones <h1/>
    <p> Chinese is a tonal language, with four different tones that distinguish between words: in short, that means that characters in Chinese that sound the same actually can have different meanings.<br>
      <p> For example, the words "送终" and "送钟" are both read with the same tones "sòngzhōng". However, they have vastly different meanings. "送终" means to "pay one's respects" (like at a funeral). Meanwhile, "送钟" means to send someone a clock. <br>
        <p> Due to the use of tones and shared pronounciations in Chinese, several idioms and sayings have arose. Using the above example, people in China tend not to send clocks or timepieces as gifts, especially not to old or sick people, since the shared pronounciations of "sending clocks" and "paying respects" gives off the connotation that you're sending them a gift that signals their coming death. <br>

  <p> The above two hompohonic puns are both a part of Chinese New Years customs. People will cook fish and leave some behind to signify having a surplus for te new year. People will also hang paper-cut decorations of upside-down "福" to represent fortune coming to their home. However, these are just a two examples of Chinese homophones.
